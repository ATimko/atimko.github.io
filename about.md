      <p>I got my inspiration when I took game design class back in high school. The program was called Zero Engine and used a mix of Zitch and C++. I've always enjoyed programming and designing, having to work on a project and diving into the deep end. Working on frontend and backend of coding is fun, all the while of debugging and fixing it. I have a hobby in designing small programming side projects as well spreading my creativity such as animations and visuals. I've worked on a personal side project using .Net Programming with C#. My favorite thing to do in my personal side project is getting to learn and improve on my website slowly. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed creating designs and programming while brainstorm ideas depending on the situation. I am known for my attention to detail and I'll do my best on focusing on what kind of problems I will encounter when programming!</p>

      <p>I thought it was a interesting minor to take and it actually ended up working really well for me. Data management class helped me understand and derust on SQL as well as learning about relational schemas, ER diagrams and ACCESS. Which helped me understand more in Database systems</p>

        Hobbies

  <div style="height: 40px;"></div>
      <p>On my off time I enjoy drawing and animating as well as playing some video games to kill some time or de-stressing. One of my favorite things to do is graphic designing a website and seeing how that may turn out. Even with this website I had fun creating it, even with some minor headaches with the strange front-end errors I've been getting. Eventually, did fix them and I've been very satisfied for how it turned out!</p>
