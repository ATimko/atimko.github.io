        Computer Science
    </h1>

  <div style="height: 40px;"></div>
      <p>I got my inspiration when I took game design class back in high school. The program was called Zero Engine and used a mix of Zitch and C++. I've always enjoyed programming and designing, having to work on a project and diving into the deep end. Working on frontend and backend of coding is fun, all the while of debugging and fixing it. I have a hobby in designing small programming side projects as well spreading my creativity such as animations and visuals. I've worked on a personal side project using .Net Programming with C#. My favorite thing to do in my personal side project is getting to learn and improve on my website slowly. I’ve always enjoyed creating designs and programming while brainstorm ideas depending on the situation. I am known for my attention to detail and I'll do my best on focusing on what kind of problems I will encounter when programming!</p>

        Business Data Analytics

      <p>I chose the minor because I thought it would be interesting, and it ended up being a great decision. I also earned a Data Analytics Certification back in 2020, which really helped prepare me for my Data Management class in 2025. It allowed me to refresh my SQL skills and deepen my understanding of relational schemas, ER diagrams, and Microsoft Access. This foundation has been especially valuable for my current work developing a messaging application in my Programming Database Systems course.</p>

        Hobbies
    </h1>
  <div style="height: 40px;"></div>
      <p>On my off time I enjoy drawing and animating as well as playing some video games to kill some time or de-stressing. One of my favorite things to do is graphic designing a website and seeing how that may turn out. Even with this website I had fun creating it, even with some minor headaches with the strange front-end errors I've been getting. Eventually, did fix them and I've been very satisfied for how it turned out!</p>
