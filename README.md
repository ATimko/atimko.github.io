# Portfoilio Project

Created using [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) using a template for [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

* A full Bootstrap 5 theme usable both on Github Pages and with a standalone Jekyll.
* Recompiles Bootstrap from SCSS files, which allows to customize Bootstrap's variables and use Bootstrap themes.
* Full support of Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins.
* Supports all features of Github Pages and Jekyll.

[This templated helped give me a baseline for this project](https://nicolas-van.github.io/bootstrap-4-github-pages/).
